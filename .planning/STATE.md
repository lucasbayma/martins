# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-23)

**Core value:** Input-to-pixel responsiveness must feel like a native GPU-accelerated terminal (Ghostty/Alacritty baseline).
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Architectural Split

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Architectural Split)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-23 — Roadmap created, 19 v1 requirements mapped across 6 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Success criterion = subjective feel test against Ghostty/Alacritty (not a ms metric)
- Text selection scope = drag-select + `cmd+c` copy only (scrollback search deferred to v2)
- Diff refresh → event-driven + 30s safety net (drop 5s timer)
- `src/app.rs` refactor is in-scope — rides the momentum of touching the event loop
- No platform expansion — macOS-only stays

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 touches ~2000 LOC of `src/app.rs`; borrow-checker friction across extracted state is the main risk — flagged in CONCERNS.md

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
